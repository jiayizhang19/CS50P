1. sorted(iterables, key=, reverse=)
    -> a function can be passed to the key argument
    -> avoid passing get_name() to the key instead get_name, as sorted() will call get_name() automatically, see Task 2, Approach 1

2. using lambda funtion in key argument if the defined function is only used once, see Task 2, Approach 2
    e.g. sorted(students, key=lambda s: s["name"],reverse=True)
    -> The lambda doesn't "know" about students directly. Instead, sorted() passes each element of students to the lambda as s.
    -> The for loop later just iterates over the sorted listâ€”it doesn't affect the lambda
