00:00  Mom, what's for dinner?
00:06  I could really go for something spicy, like chili.
00:10  Spicy?
00:11  I'm not into spicy food right now.
00:14  Gee, I've been so busy with house cleaning that I haven't given dinner a single thought.
00:20  Anyway, I don't feel much like cooking.
00:23  I'm just too tired to prepare a meal, even a small one.
00:28  Plus, there's almost nothing in the fridge because we didn't make it to the grocery store this weekend.
00:34  What do you say we order some food?
00:37  Good idea, dad. Let's order Chinese food.
00:40  Then we have a menu somewhere.
00:43  The last time we ordered from that place, the food was greasy and it took them forever to deliver.
00:49  But you know what?
00:52  There's a new Greek restaurant downtown.
00:55  I heard they deliver very fast.
00:59  But as in Greek would have lots of garlic, just the thought of garlic turns me off.
01:04  Garlic's good for you. I can't get enough of it myself.
01:09  At this rate, we'll never get anything to eat.
01:11  I'm starving. You two are too picky.
01:15  Let's better order some pizza and put on a good movie.
01:20  Good idea.
01:22  I'm crazy about pizza.
01:24  In fact, my favorite is Hawaiian.
01:27  I don't like Hawaiian pizza. I can't stand pineapple on pizza.
01:32  I prefer to eat fruit for dessert.
01:35  Not with the main course, so I'll go for chicken pizza.
01:39  I'll have pepperoni.
01:42  Me too.
